== Code for school assignments and projects ==

This is the main directory of all my school assignments and projects code. At the moment 98% is missing. I plan on adding it over time.

Down from here i will tell you which directory is what class. Every code starts with an 'I'. This stands for "Informatica", which is a dutch translation of "Computer Science".
* [[#IAD1]]
* [[#IEPRO]]
=== IAD1 ===

IAD1 is "Informatica: Algorithms and Data structures 1".
=== IEPRO ===

IEPRO is "Informatica: Embedded Programming". In this class we pretty much learned about how to write a application/game for the "Nintendo DS".
